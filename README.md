# Design

### Start Page

I wanted to have the the start button to align up with the play buttons, on the play page, so that you dont have to move the mouse when starting the game.

- <b>Font</b> : I got my font from [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
- <b>Icons</b> : I used the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) website for all my icons.
- <b>Icon images</b> : I got the images for the play buttons from[flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/).

# Deployment

The website was deployed to my account on GitHub pages. The steps I took to deploy the website went as followed: 
  - Go to my [GitHub repository called PP2](https://github.com/ObiWanBonobi/PP2).
  - In there, I navigated to the Settings tab.
  - From the source section drop-down menu, I selected the Master Branch.
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment. 

You can see deployed wedsite [here](https://obiwanbonobi.github.io/PP2/index.html).

# Credits

- <b>Code Ideas</b> : Some of my ideas grew from coding along projects called, [Love Math](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/love-maths) and [Love Running project](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/readme-template), created by Code Institute.
- <b>Code help</b> : I got some help from my mentor, [Oluwafemi Medale](https://github.com/omedale), who helped me with some future ideas. And my brother in law, [Steffen Bjerken√•s](https://github.com/stebje), who taught me a lot about JavaScript and helped me with some of the code.
- <b>README</b> : I copied some of the Readme code from my [previous Project](https://github.com/ObiWanBonobi/PP1/blob/main/README.md).
- <b>JavaScript</b> : I got some of my JavaScript ideas from [this online project](https://codepen.io/Creasium/pen/NWGOGrr?editors=1000).
- <b>Learning</b> : 
  * [This website](https://www.basedash.com/blog/how-to-add-an-image-in-an-array-in-javascript) helped me to understand how to add images to a JavaScript file.
  * [Thie website](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63591210/hide-elements-after-a-certain-value-with-javascript) helped me understand how to add my red needs bubble.
  * [This website](https://codepen.io/Suza_3/pen/xxbLLzP?editors=1010) helped me undertand better how to randomize my images.
  * [This Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ec8vSKJuZTk) helped me understand JavaScript better.

- <b>Most of my credit goes to the Code Institute program where I made notes on every section and got most of my ideas and code from there.</b>
